## Game Features

- **4 Unique Phases** - Each with increasing difficulty and unique enemy patterns

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** - Move your character
- **Space** - Start game (from menu)
- **M** - Toggle background music
- **G** - Toggle God Mode (secret)

### Objective
Survive as long as possible by dodging red enemy squares. The game gets progressively harder through 4 phases:

1. **Phase 1: BASIC** (Green) - Enemies move in straight lines
2. **Phase 2: AIM** (Yellow) - Enemies aim directly at you
3. **Phase 3: MIXED** (Orange) - Combination of both enemy types
4. **Phase 4: ENDLESS PHASE** (Red) - Maximum intensity, no end!

Each phase lasts 30 seconds before transitioning to the next level of difficulty.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Play Locally (No Setup Required)

1. Download all files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Press Space to start playing!

### Option 2: Add Custom Music

1. Create a `music` folder in the game directory
2. Add your MP3 files with these names:
   ```
   music/
   ├── phase1.mp3
   ├── phase2.mp3
   ├── phase3.mp3
   └── phase4.mp3
   ```
3. Launch the game - it will automatically use your music!

**Note:** If music files are not found, the game will run silently (sound effects still work).

## Music Recommendations

For the best experience, use music that matches each phase's intensity:

- **Phase 1**: Calm, chill music (100-110 BPM)
- **Phase 2**: Tense, focused music (110-130 BPM)
- **Phase 3**: Intense, fast music (130-150 BPM)
- **Phase 4**: Aggressive, extreme music (150+ BPM)

## Customization

### Adjust Music Volume

```

### Change Phase Duration
Edit `game.js` line ~121:
```javascript
const PHASE_DURATION = 30; // seconds (default: 30)
```
